#### Time Boxing
Time Boxing is a technique of defining an specific ammount of time to a certain task in advance. This is really helpful to get the most out of your time and increase your productivity. IMO it works because you don't waste time focusing on the details, you go straight to the main problem and worry about the details later.
I think this technique applies what is called the Paretto rule. Most times you can do the 80% of the work in 20% of the time, but only if you prioritize right. And I think Time Boxing really helps you in that aspect.
Also it's perfect to combine this technique with the Pomodoro one that I already applied.

### Communication Skills
There are 2 main points in this.
1. **Ask better questions:** This is really simple. This is simple, and it goes like this. Do the research >> Wonder what your menthor would tell you if you were in that scenario >> If it's still unsolved, then ask.
 Of course there are finer details, like how much time you should research before asking. But I think it's a good general rule and it would all depend on the availability of your menthors.
 
 2. **Always be present:** I heard this several time in the academy, but to be honest this week I really saw the importance of this. I had the chance to attend a communication class and it put me on perspective on what people can see when you lack communication. Even when you're not saying something, you're transimiting a message of who you are.
