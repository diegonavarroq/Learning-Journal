# Week 21

This might be the last essay I write as an Academy (maybe not). It has been quite a journey...

Over the last 4 months I have grown so much, both as a person and as an engineer. Time went out really fast. During my time here I met great people and lived great experiences, and for that I'm really grateful.

I'm grateful that I had the chance to work with great people that became friends, that I had very cool mentors, and I'm grateful with Dayra and Luis that made everything possible.

Anyway, enough with the cheesy stuff. Here's what I learned :).

## Nodejs + Slack api + Reactjs
This week I took quite a challenge. In my last essay I talked you about how I was working with Nodejs for the first time. Now I'm still working with Nodejs, but in addition to that I've been learning React and how to use the Slack API, in order to make a login with Slack.

My learnings have been mostly about how to manage Components, Hooks, State, Promises, Async/Await in React/JS. I'm still a newbie at the frontend with JavaScript, but I'm having a great time learning. I think I'm in a good path to become a Full Stack Developer.
