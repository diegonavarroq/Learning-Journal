# Week 14

### [Go back to index](http://luis-valdez.github.io/Learning-Journal)

This week was the last one of the Open Source phase of the internship. For me this was probably the most challenging phase of all. Mostly because it was just me looking out for issues, the work wasn't given to me, I had to go out and find a task that suited my habilities and my interests. It may sound simple, but the extra step of looking out for issues was difficult to overcome at some moments during the phase. There were moments where I felt really frustrated, I wanted to work on something but couldn't find a proper issue available.

On the good side, I had the chance to learn a lot from how they organize and manage in Open Source projects. It's really different from builing your own project from scratch, to get involved in a mature project with its own rules and conventions. I think it was a really valuable experience because it gave me the chance to contribute in projects with talented people from different cultures.

From the technical side, this week I had the chance to learn a couple of things:

### How to make a good PR
On my [last Pull Request](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-java/pull/95) I worked on my biggest contribution, basically it was implementing a new feature. This was way bigger than my past contributions. So I tried my best to make a good PR that was understandable and that everyone that read it had a good notion of what it was.
This were the main takeaways that I have from reasearching and working on that PR:

1. Write comments that make your code more understandable
2. Keep the body of the PR short and clear
3. Be ready to take feedback
4. Highlight what you think it's worth discussing

Overall working with Open Source has been quite a journey fulfilled with many lessons. And I'm looking forward to work on the next phase if this internship.
