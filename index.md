### [How To Talk To Anyone] (https://sive.rs/book/HowToTalkToAnyone)

While doing this reading I have to admit that I wasn't 100% in agreement with what I read, mostly because it came out to me as to manipulative or machiavelic, I understand that maybe a politician or a 'big cat' as the autor calls them has to use them to get what they want, but honestly I just didn't feel comfortable with some of them.
Nonetheless there are cool things I learned:

**Body Language Stuff:**
- Pivot towards the person you're talking.
- Avoid touching your face a lot.
- When someone arrives wait one second and then smile, this will make them feel welcome.

**After saying hi:**
- People want to be convinced that everything is OK and the two of you are similar.
- When you say your profession, add some interesting facts.
- If you don't know what to say repeat the last words.
- Go back to an interrupted stories, the other person will thank you.

**VIP Talk:**
Maybe this was the hardest part to read, I just don't like the idea of deliberately changing the way you talk and behave to be liked by other people, but here are some interesting points that I agree with.
- If someone gives you an unwanted question twice, reply with the same answer twice.
- Never make a joke at someone else expense, it's just bad taste.
- You can amplify your vocabulary to avoid cliches.

**Phone Calls:**
I think this one is particularly relevant now that a lot of interaction (or most) is done by calls or video-calls.
- Replace your gestures with sounds.
- Say the other person name a lot.
- Answer calmly and when you realize who's calling give them a happy greeting!

Of course there were a lot more of tips, but these were the ones that I think I will really try to aply because they resonate with me. Learning to communicate properly can be hard, so that is why this topic has a lot to offer.
