### Overview

### [How To Talk To Anyone](https://sive.rs/book/HowToTalkToAnyone)

While doing this reading I have to admit that I wasn't 100% in agreement with what I read, mostly because it came out to me as to manipulative or machiavelic, I understand that maybe a politician or a 'big cat' as the autor calls them has to use them to get what they want, but honestly I just didn't feel comfortable with some of them.
Nonetheless there are cool things I learned:

**Body Language Stuff:**
- Pivot towards the person you're talking.
- Avoid touching your face a lot.
- When someone arrives wait one second and then smile, this will make them feel welcome.

**After saying hi:**
- People want to be convinced that everything is OK and the two of you are similar.
- When you say your profession, add some interesting facts.
- If you don't know what to say repeat the last words.
- Go back to an interrupted stories, the other person will thank you.

**VIP Talk:**
Maybe this was the hardest part to read, I just don't like the idea of deliberately changing the way you talk and behave to be liked by other people, but here are some interesting points that I agree with.
- If someone gives you an unwanted question twice, reply with the same answer twice.
- Never make a joke at someone else expense, it's just bad taste.
- You can amplify your vocabulary to avoid cliches.

**Phone Calls:**
I think this one is particularly relevant now that a lot of interaction (or most) is done by calls or video-calls.
- Replace your gestures with sounds.
- Say the other person name a lot.
- Answer calmly and when you realize who's calling give them a happy greeting!

Of course there were a lot more of tips, but these were the ones that I think I will really try to aply because they resonate with me. Learning to communicate properly can be hard, so that is why this topic has a lot to offer.

### [Profound lessons from Stanford Professor](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-profound-life-lessons-from-Stanford-Professor-John-Ousterhout?share=1)
To be honest I've never heard of Professor John Ousterhout before this read, but I'm glad that I was exposed to his ideas, I'll list each one of them and add some insigths.

- First take your system from non-working to working. A lot of times programmers can spend a lot of time thinking of optimization or the perfect code, but first you should focus on making the thing work and then from that starting point, do iterations to refactor or improve the code
- Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them. You see this all the time on the internet, people have the intuition about some idea and they're willing to defend that idea to death, instead of actually questioning if they're right.
- Facts precede concepts. And idea so simple and elegant that had never crossed my mind, but of course I think I applied this without thinking about it. This just means that to understand a concept you have to observe several examples and identify the pattern of that particular concept.
- If you don't know what fixed the problem you haven't fixed it. This has happened to me a lot of time during school projects, modify x, y and z. Then suddenly the problem is solved. Do I know what solved it? Nope. Now I know that that behavior was not a good programming practice.
- The three most powerful words for building credibility are "I don't know". Of course! Makes a lot of sense to me now, being able to admit you don't know stuff will make you more credible for when you actually know.
- Coherent systems are inherenyly unstable. I find some beauty in this, the world is chaotic and we as humans are always trying to make things our way, to have our stuff stacked and organized. But entropy always strike, no matter what you do. You have to be in peace with this, and understand that things are going to fail at some point.

###[Ideas are just a multiplier of execution](https://sive.rs/multiply)
This one was a really short one, but powerful. I'll try to resume it in one phrase:

> Ideas are worth nothing by themselves, they become worthy when executed.

This reminds me of a meme:
