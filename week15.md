This is my first essay of 2021 and I'm proud to tell you that despite the really challenging past year, 2020 was the year with more professional learning for me so far. I have learned so much during this internship, and I expect to keep learning more.

Anyways, here's what I learned this past week.

## JavaScript
I've been learning this language for a while now. Since I was in university, I was told about the importance of JavaScript. And it makes a lot of sense, everything now is on the web (or almost anything). And JavaScript is the only language that can run on a web browser (besides web assembly), so there's no question that it is a language that is worth getting familiar with.

This past week I dedicated an important ammount of time trying to summarize concepts of the language. I wrote [this article](https://github.com/luis-valdez/Learning-Journal/blob/gh-pages/articles/javascript-questions.md) which includes a bunch of questions and answers about JavaScript. I didn't took the time to iterate and improve the article, because right now it's only a material of study for me.

## Data Structures
