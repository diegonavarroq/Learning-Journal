This past month has been a real roller coaster ride. It's the end of the phase Build Something From Scratch. And as the name says, I had a chance to work with a team to build a system from the ground. This is something that I've done before but only as a school project, but this felt way more real and serious.
I learned quite a lot of technichal and non technical stuff from this past week, so let's begin.

### Communication is key. Own your sh!t. - Optimism Bias.
This week we made a huge mistake. We didn't finished the work that we were supposed to deliver. But that wasn't the real problem, the worse thing was that we didn't communicate it to the client with enough time.
After the presentation demo I felt really bad because I had worked so hard and still the results that I wanted weren't there. 
From that point I tried to understood what happened to correct my mistakes. And the answer was sitting as a link in my email.
There is a video from that we had to watch from this month homework
