## The Inner Game of Tennis
This is a really brilliant article that is done from a book.
I was really amazed by how much I could relate to this.
Basically the book talks about how we have to inner selfs, one that has ego and cares about if we do right or if we do bad. And the other one just cares about being a flowing state, is our innate hability to do things and learn things, is our body and our brain.

I really enjoy playing basketball, and over the years I stop playing and then start playing again. But there's one thing I'm obsessed about, and that's my jumpshot. I'm fascinated by this because, it's just me the ball and the basket. And while I'm throwing jumpshots I'm always overthinking every tiny detail of my shot. If my elbow was in the right angle, if I bend my knees enough, If I flicked my wrist correctly, you get the idea.

Up until today, I thought that this was making me improve, but now after reading, I think that it was actually damaging my game. This explains why some days I can shoot with a 60% precision and now the other day I decrease to 20% or even lower. It's specially when I do worse that I become more self aware of my shot and try to fix it right away.

Basically the book states that this is a wrong approach that is pure ego. And I agree, to enter "the zone" while learning or reading or playing a sport. You just enter in a flow state where you don't over analyze. You trust your body, and if you fail, you don't judge yourself from a good/bad perspective.

Of course I know that this will be easier said than done, but I'm really impatient to apply this in several aspects of my life. While reading, while solving a coding problem, and specially while improving my jumpshot!
