### Array vs ArrayList in Java
|                 | Array                                                                                                                                    | ArrayList                                                                                                                                                    | Details                                                                                                                                                   |

| Declaration     | int[] arr = new int[10];                                                                                                                 | ArrayList<Type> arrList = new ArrayList();                                                                                                                   | - Arrays need to be initialized with a fixed size<br>- ArrayList have dynamic size                                                                         |
| Origin          | It comes from basic Java functionality                                                                                                   | It comes with the Collections Java Framework                                                                                                                 | - To use ArrayLists you need to import a class<br>- ArrayLists have methods to access and modify its members<br>- Arrays members are accessed trough `[]` |
| Type of members | Can contain both primitive datatypes and objects<br>(only one datatype at the same time)                                                 | ArrayLists only supports object entries                                                                                                                      | - If you use `arrList.add(1)` It will convert it to an Integer object.                                                                                    |
| Storage         | If the datatype of the array is primitive, they're stored at a contiguous location.<br><br>If not, the storage is similar as ArrayLists. | Members of ArrayLists are always references to objects at different memory locations.<br><br>Therefore the objects are never stores in contiguous locations. | - ArrayLists have many methods like `indexOf` and `remove` which are not supported by Arrays                                                              |
