# Week 10

### [Go back to index](http://luis-valdez.github.io/Learning-Journal)

This week we're starting with a new phase called OpenSource (OS). And sure there is a lot to learn when starting in something completely new.
Of course I had previously heard about OpenSource, but I had never actually took the time to learn about it. For starters there is a bunch of things that you should know before getting involved. Let's start simple and easy:

**What is an OpenSource project?**
Is a software project that has its codebase out in the open and anyone can download the code, read it, make modifications, and if you're dedicated enough; contribute to it. There are many great projects that are widely used that are OS like TensorFlow and Django.

**Why should you contribute to OpenSource?**
At first the idea of contributing to OS can seem crazy to some people. Because well you're working for a project that is not paying you with money.
But the rewards that an OS give you are from a different kind, if you're a Junior dev like me it helps you a lot to get experience. Specially working with big projects, because so far when I work in code it's usually code I built and that I know. With this is a change of paradigm, I start with a codebase that is already built and I have to understand how it works. It's a great exercise.

Now let's say that you decide you want to contribute to a project.

**How do I choose a project?**
My advice is select a project based in three things.
1. Select a project you're excited about.
2. Make sure you have some expertise in the technology stack you will be working.
3. Look for a label 'Good First issue', it's a sign that the projects accepts newcomers.

You'll have to surf trough a lot of projects to find one that suits those 3 things. Happy OS hunting.
