# Week 20

This past week I started a new and final phase at my Internship. I'll be working with a real project with real users, and I'm very excited about it.

Let me share with you what I've learned starting this new phase.

# Software Failues
This past week I had the chance to make some readings about Why Software Fails, and other interesting facts related to failure.

First, lets start with the fact that there are billions of dollars that have been wasted in software because of failed projects. The first time you hear that it comes as a shocker, but honestly once you analyze it, it's not hard to believe.

We've been perfecting the process of software engineering over the years, and how we've been doing this? By failing, we do things one way and realize something and then find a better way to do it. And also, software is complicated. There are just many things that you have to know, that you have to be prepared for, and honestly I don't think that our brains were prepared to deal with all of this. That's why software is imperfect, it resembles us.

Another thing I realized was that the ammount of legacy projects that are out there is high. And eventually those legacy systems will have the need of evolving. And this can happen because they are no longer worth mantaining or maybe just because a new initiative.

Anyway, we as developers and as humans are destined to fail eventually. And being able to embrace failure and learn from it is priceless.

# Getting Started
One interesting thing about my week is that I got started in a new project, and naturally I started working in some technologies that I hadn't worked before. For example I started working with Nodejs and Expressjs.
Both of these technologies are new for me. So I applied what I think is the best way of learning something new: Get your hands dirty!

I started building APIs, I started from the most basic and crappy, and then tried to move forward to a little less crappy. Eventually I started understanding what was happening with my code and being able to create better projects with more features.

This is a fragment of a comment that I read long ago in Reddit and I've been believing firmly since then:

Stop all tutorials right now, and until the end of this month dedicate your time to ONLY these two things:
1.	⁠Pump out a ridiculous amount of sh!tty simple programs.
2.	⁠Severely reduce your standards for the type of projects you find "interesting". If an idea sounds >interesting to you, it's too complicated.

This helped me in my early years in programming and I've been carrying it since then. It transmits a very simple but powerful idea: Start simple and be constant, eventually you'll move on to the cool stuff.
