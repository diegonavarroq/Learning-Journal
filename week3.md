### Overview
- The Myth of the Genius Programmer.

We have a lot of ground to cover so get ready to get a peek about everything I learned this week. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

### [The Myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)
The talk begins with the two presenters talking about these programming legends that a lot of us start admiring at the beginning of our journey as developers like Guido van Rossum or Linus Torvalds, and how this builds up to people wanting to be perceived as geniuses that commits no mistakes. They use this very funny analogy as how people want to get locked up in their genius cave and then come out to the world with this perfect product already finished and with 0 flaws. 

I felt personally identified with this, because there was a point in University time, that when I didn't know something from a class, instead of asking I waited until the class ended and tried to learn it on my own. And now that I see it in retrospective I realize how stupid that was, the purpose of the class was that, clear my doubts and get knowledge. But instead I wanted to be perceived as a smart guy and we all know that smart guys don't make mistakes, right?

From my example we can see that the consequences weren't that bad, I just wasted some time and eventually I started pushing myself to ask questions and show my vulnerability. But in the talk is mentioned that there's people who can waste months or years working in what they think would be the next great idea in the industry. And in reality their idea can suck or not be as good as they believe. The problem is that if they don't get any exposure early on, there would be no one to critize them and tell them their flaws or mistakes.

Other than this, they mentioned a very interesting comparison between working with Open Source software and traveling with a group of people, there's a sweet-spot of 2 to 3 people at the beginning of a project to gain different perspective but also being able to agree on what direction give the project. I found this particularly funny, because I experiencied this myself whent traveling with friends. When the group gets too big, there is just no way for everyone to agree and take decisions on time. You will just spend your time in corners talking about you should do withoud doing anything.

This particular video talked about the performance of web pages, particularly in cell phones. To be honest I was completely non-familiar with the topic of this video, great opportunity to learn, right?

These are some of my main takeaways:
- What you can measure you can optimize
- There is a loop for performance improvement, it goes like this: Gather Data >> Make Insights >> Take Action >> Repeat
- There are 3 pillars of web performance:
  1. Network -> Optimize Critical Path.
  2. Render -> Reduce number of paints.
  3. Compute -> Reduce JS execution time.
- I really didn't know what was Paint in this concept, but from what I searched is this: Paint is when the web browser creates a visual representation.
- Browsers cannot paint until critical path is resolved.
